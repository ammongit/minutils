### minutils

A minimalist implementation of some of the coreutils for fun.
Each binary performs exactly one kind of action (except `ln` which
makes both hard and symbolic links), provides no --help messages, and
simply quit with a nonzero return code if an error occurs or invalid arguments
are passed.
